# Car Collector App
Built with Django v2.2, Python 3, Materialize CSS Framework, and PostgreSQL

## Description
This application was developed to learn about and develop my understanding of creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data within the Django web framework. The application utilizes 1:M and M:M relationships within its models. It also utilizes Amazon Web Services' S3 storage for uploading and downloading images. Additionally, I make use of key Django features, such as class-based views and authentication/authorization.
